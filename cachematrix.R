## Cache the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly
## These functions cache the inverse of a matric

## This function creates a special matrix object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Computes the inverse of the matric computed by makeCacheMatrix
## If the inverse has already been calculated then cacheSolve retrieves the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
